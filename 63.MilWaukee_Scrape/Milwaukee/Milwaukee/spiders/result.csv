Forget the showers of hot metal chips and sparks that were once an aerial threat on metal construction jobsites. The 6370 shears the metal, producing a virtually spark-free wake and cool, burr and scorch-free edges that don't require post-cut finishing. Cool cut waste, in the form of metal shavings, is effectively contained with a durable magnesium blade shield and channeled into the saw's integral ChipTank. Cool cutting also means that materials can be handled almost immediately following a cut, reducing downtime. Driven by a powerful 15 amp (1-3/4 max HP), 3,700 RPM motor and equipped with a full grill of razor-sharp, cermet-tip teeth, the 6370 tears through tough cuts without hesitation. Count on up to 10 gauge sheets and 1/4 in. steel plate cuts, all day, every day. More extreme cuts, even up to 3/4 in. steel plate, are possible when proper operating techniques are used. Any way you slice it, cold cutting metal means value. Internal test results indicate that our new metal cutting blades last a minimum of 25 times a standard abrasive wheel. Specially-formulated cermet tip metallurgy and tooth geometry ensure these incredible blades cut faster, stay sharp longer, and resist more impacts. Translation? A significantly lower cost per cut ($0.20 versus $0.60), not to mention the savings associated with 1 versus 25 blade changes. To keep on target, the new 6370 features a set of on-board sight-line and blade point-of-entry indicators along with a slot in the saw's shoe for a rip fence. It is also the first and only corded metal cutting saw to feature a lower guard retraction lever. Plunge cuts, a frequent challenge for metal roofing contractors, are fast and furious with this exciting new tool. The lever's location, adjacent to the side handle, ensures that the user has both hands firmly on the saw throughout the cut. Beyond its capacity to cut solid, thicker gauge materials, the 6370, with a 2-9/16 in. cut-depth, screams through most corrugated metal roofing and decking sheets, structural, shape, grating and framing materials in one-pass. Insufficient cut depth means material must be flipped over and re-cut, usually a two-man operation. To ensure a smooth ride, the new 6370 is equipped with a set of serious comfort features. The tool's rear and side handles feature soft, tactile gripping surfaces and are designed to comfortably fit any user's hands. The side handle is canted forward to reduce wrist strain as well as wrapped completely to the motor housing, offering maximum comfort and control in any cutting orientation. Down-time is lost time so we've added valuable, time-saving features to the 6370. Removing the blade shield to discard cut waste or change blades is effortless with our exclusive, quick-release shield buckle. The remaining saw controls are conveniently located to ensure fast, effortless operation before, during and after the cut.","Dry-cut technology provides faster, cleaner, more affordable metal cutting | Durable blade shield with integral chiptank deflects/collects hot chips and sparks | Plunge lever for fast, effective plunge cuts | Exclusive quick-release shield latch for fast waste disposal and blade changes | 2-9/16 in. cut depth for one-pass cuts through most common materials | Powerful 15.0 amp, 3,700 rpm motor | Premium cermet-tipped blades cut faster, cleaner, and longer than other carbide-tipped or friction blades","(1),8"" Metal Cutting Saw,(6370-20),

These cutters are designed to be used in hand held drills to achieve drill press quality holes. The carbide tips stay sharper longer than high-speed steel or bi-metal cutters giving these cutters longer life. Lubrication during drilling extends the life of the carbide cutter. Milwaukee recommends the use of Hawg Wash cutting fluid for best results. Hawg Wash fluid is available in 16 ounce bottles (49-32-0081). One bottle makes one gallon of lubricating solution.

The longer shaft length makes it easy to drill deeper or overhead without an extension. The set includes 1/2"", 3/4"" and 1"" ship auger bits in a roll-up pouch with room for extra bits.","Durable: Hardened, one-face 20° rake angle design enhances nail resistance, chip removal and fast, easy sharpening | Fast chip removal: Nonstick, polished and coated flutes eliminate costly cleaning time | Impact-rated shank: Strong enough to use with an impact wrench | Versatile: One line of Milwaukee® ship auger bits covers all applications and tools","
